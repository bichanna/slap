**WARNING!! THIS LANGUAGE IS IN DEVELOPMENT (AND FOR LEARNING PURPOSES). ANYTHING CAN CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT.**

üñê **SLAP** stands for "**SL**ow **A**nd **P**owerless." And I hope to make it "**P**owerful" someday.<br>
>I'm planning to create a simple transpiler that compiles to JavaScript (see [compiler branch](https://github.com/bichanna/slap/tree/compiler)). So, SLAP might become pretty fast in the future.

**SLAP** is a dynamically- and strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language with a small portion of functional-language-like features. Its syntax is a member of the C family with a bit of difference.

As of March 2022, you can write pretty decent, small programs in SLAP.

Here's an example SLAP program. ([samples](https://github.com/bichanna/slap/tree/master/samples))
```js
import "std";

let areas = ["tools", "game", "web", "science", "systems", "embedded", "drivers", "mobile", "GUI"];

forEach(areas) <- def (area) => println("Hello, ${area} developers!");
```

## Installation
On Linux/macOS, you may be able to run the following commands to install SLAP.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bichanna/slap.git
$ cd slap
$ chmod +x ./build.sh 
$ ./build.sh         # The SLAP Vim highlighter automatically gets installed
```
For Windows, I haven't written bat version of `build.sh`, so you have to manually compile the source code.
```
$ nimble build --multimethods:on -d:release
```
Then, mark it as an executable file if necessary, and try running `slap --version`.
```
$ slap --version
SLAP 0.0.3
```

You may want to test current SLAP you just built before running your programs.
```
$ nimble test
```
