**WARNING!! THIS LANGUAGE IS IN DEVELOPMENT. ANYTHING CAN CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT.**

**SLAP** stands for **Sl**ow **A**nd **P**owerless, and I hope to make it '**P**owerfull' someday.

**SLAP** is a dynamically- and strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language. Its syntax is a member of the C family; it is not meant to be groundbreaking but rather to feel similar with a bit of difference.

Here's an example SLAP program.
```py
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i = i + 1) {
    if (i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0) {
        writeln("fizzbuzz");
    } elif (i % 3 == 0) {
        writeln("fizz");
    } elif (i % 5 == 0) {
        writeln("buzz");
    } else {
        writeln(i);
    }
}
```
