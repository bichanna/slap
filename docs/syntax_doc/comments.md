## Comments
Comments in SLAP begin with the hash character.
```
# This is a comment
println("This will be printed"); # Another comment
```
Multi-line or block comments begin with the hash and curly bracket, `#{`, and are terminated with a closing curly bracket followed by a hash, `}#`. Multi-line comments can be nested.
```
#{
    This is a block comment.
    #{ I'm nested. }#
}#
```
